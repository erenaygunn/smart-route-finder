# Implementation Report

## Overview

Smart Route Navigator is a web application that calculates the shortest path between two points on a map using Dijkstra's algorithm. It visualizes the path, distance, and estimated time.

## Implementation Details

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

The shortest path is calculated by using Dijkstra's algorithm, which evaluates the shortest distance from the starting node to all other nodes. The algorithm uses priority queue to select the next node to process.

### Map Integration

Used Leaflet.js for rendering the map. OpenStreetMap tiles are used as the base layer. Users can click on the map to select start and end points.

### Data Handling

The map graph is represented as an adjacency list, where nodes correspond to map points, and edges represent the connections between them with associated weights (distances).

### Functions

Key functions:

- **initializeMap**: Set up the map and add event listeners.
- **calculateShortestPath**: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to evaluate the shortest path.
- **renderPath**: Visualizes the path on map using polylines.
- **updateUI**: Updates the distance and estimated time displayed to the user.

## Conclusion

This project implements the use of Dijkstra's algorithm in a real application with focus on UX and interactivity. The integration of map rendering, efficient pathfinding shows the practical application of algorithms.
